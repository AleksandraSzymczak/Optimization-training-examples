### The cake factory problem
#### Decription
We can make two types of cakes A and B.
To make each cake we need to use:

            Flour(g)	Fat(g)
    Cake A   200	      25

    Cake B   100	      50

 We only have 5kg of flour and 1kg of fat.
 How can we maximize the number of produced cakes?

 To solve this problem, we can use graphical or arithmetic methods.

 This is a linear optimization problem because both the constraints and the objective function are linear equations and inequalities.
